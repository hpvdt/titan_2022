Start up script for TITAN 2022

This script is called to set up the RPi for use. This has a few steps:
1. Start safe shut down script
2. Determine if it is front or rear unit. Done by checking for ANT stick.
3. Launch the right bike binaries based on which RPi it is

Should be set to run at startup by editing rc.local
> "sudo nano /etc/rc.local"
